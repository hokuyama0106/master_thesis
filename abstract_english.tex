The ATLAS Experiment is being conducted with the Large Hadron Colider at CERN. The parposes are measureing the Standard Model(SM) and searching for particles beyond the SM.

To get more statistics and for more advanced measurement and analysis, LHC is plannig to increase the luminosity, which corresponds to a probability of the proton$-$proton collision. It is called HL-LHC.
The luminosity is approximately 7 times bigger than the current one and the integrated luminosity is 10 times.

Deu to the upgrade, it is required for detectors to have more radiation resistance and high position resolution and so on. 
It is planed to replace the ATLAS inner detector and the new detector called Inner Tracker(ITk). 
ITk is all composed of silicon detestors and covers much more wider area than the current Inner Detector.

For the production of the ITk, we are planning to make 10,000 modules and take a lot of tests for quarity control(QC tests) for each. 
There are many items for the tests and those are taken repeatedly in the production flow.
Additionally all the QC tests should be uploaded to a central database, which is set up at unicorn university in check public, to save the performance of the module itself and reference in the operation of the ITk. 
For this production, I have developed a local database system to manage data at the local production site and syncronize informations and QC results to the central database and spread its system and functions for collaborators.

For speading the DB system, I took a tutorial for system users for the production at CERN in February,2020. Inspired the efforts, the system have been spreading and now several production sites have installed and been tesing the system.

Concering the development of the DB system, I implemented some needed functions for the production,for example searching results, syncronizing data between the local and the central database, and confirmed that we can use the whole functionalities of the system, including my developed tools, with equipments at the laboratory on campas. 
Additionally I confirmed that we can use the tools with the actual amount of data at the production to measure the processing time of the tools.
